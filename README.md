# DataFit
Welcome to DataFit! This shiny Application allows you to track your body weight and
strength training information to assess your fitness goals. This app was created to be used
alongside the Wendler 5/3/1 Strength Program; however, this app can also be used with
other weightlifting regimens and long distance runners.

### How to use:
Load the ui.R and server.R file and knit it to use the application.

The "Home" tab allows you to enter the date, your body weight, your calorie goal, the physical
activity that you trained, the intensity and reps of that activity, and a note on that training
date. 

The "Progress by numbers" demonstrates your progress in strength, speed, and bodyweight over time.

The "Progress by day" demonstrates your stats and a picture of your physique for that 
given training day.


### Upload Photos:
In order to view photos of yourself within the app, you must create a
folder titled "www" and upload each picture with the name organized as YYYY-MM-DD-1.
If you choose to upload more than one photo of yourself on a given training day,
then title these photos with -2, -3, -4, etc.
  
  Example: I want to upload 2 pictures of myself taken the morning of December 30th, 2019
  These photos would be uploaded to www under the name 2019-12-30-1.jpg and 2019-12-30-2.jpg
